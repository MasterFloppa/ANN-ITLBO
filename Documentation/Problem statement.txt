Problem Statement: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using TLBO

Description:
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in which a salesman must visit a set of cities 
exactly once and return to the starting city, aiming to minimize the total distance traveled. The problem has numerous 
real-world applications, including route planning, logistics, and transportation scheduling.

Given a set of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the objective is to find the shortest possible route 
that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. The challenge lies in exploring the exponentially large 
search space of possible routes to find the optimal or near-optimal solution efficiently.

Objective:
Minimize the total distance traveled by finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns 
to the starting city.

Problem Formulation:
Given a set of cities with their coordinates, the objective is to find a permutation P of cities such that:

1. Each city is visited exactly once.
2. The route starts and ends at the same city (the starting city).
3. The total distance traveled along the route is minimized.
